## ü§î why bother

GitHub Actions is and event-oriented system. Your workflows run in response to events triggered independently and without coordination. In a shared repository, if two or more people merge pull requests those will each trigger workflows each without regard to one another.

This can be problematic for workflows used as part of a continuous deployment process. You might want to let an in-flight deployment complete before progressing further with the next workflow. This is the usecase turnstyle action targets.

## ü§∏ Usage

The typical setup for turnstyle involves adding job step using `softprops/turnstyle@master`.

```diff
name: Main

on: push

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
+     - name: Turnstyle
+       uses: softprops/turnstyle@master
+       env:
+         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Deploy
        run: sleep 30
```
